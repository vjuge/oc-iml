# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Introduction

In the following notebooks, we'll explore the content of [OpenFoodFact](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/) dataset

Prior to run, please download the dataset at [https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/en.openfoodfacts.org.products.csv](), and **copy it into the current folder**

Also, you can discover the [dataset description](./input/data-fields.txt)

Prior to run the notebooks, intall the required dependencies : `pip install -r ../requirements.txt`

Please run each notebook in the correct order : `P2_NN_xxxx.ipynb`, where `NN` represent the ordinal number.

The file [module_P2_utils](./module_P2_utils.ipynb) contains some custom functions that help the analysis.

This dataset is quite huge, so please ensure you have enough memory prior running them (16Gb Ram is the absolute minimum)

## Target

These notebooks follows OpenClassroom's 'Ing√©nieur machine Learning' [P2 assignment](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/148/projects/628/assignment)

The goal is to

* Clean, Prepare and understand the data
* Make univariate and multivariate analysis
* Propose an application idea


Show representations of the dataset through univariate and multivariate analysis
