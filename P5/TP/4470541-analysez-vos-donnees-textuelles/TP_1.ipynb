waterers is cuba.\\', \\'\\', \\'but up until a few years ago, even for intrepid travelers like the waterers, visiting cuba would have been close to impossible.\\', \\'\\', \\'after fidel castro took power in 1959, cuba went from being a favorite getaway for americans to a forbidden destination. diplomatic relations and direct travel between the united states and cuba were cut off. u.s. citizens spending money on the island faced hefty fines for \"trading with the enemy.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'but after decades of false starts, the obama administration has reinstituted legal travel to cuba as a way to reach out to the cuban people.\\', \\'\\', \\'it\\\\\\'s called \"people-to-people\" travel, and like nearly everything involving cuba, controversy and politics are involved.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in cuba,\" u.s. treasury department guidelines for people-to-people travel read.\\', \\'\\', \\'and while the policy has kicked off a debate over what is a \"meaningful\" exchange, a flood of tour operators has entered the still uncertain world of travel to cuba.\\', \\'\\', \\'americans interested in visiting cuba are offered free cds of cuban music and itineraries that include welcome parties thrown by committees for the defense of the revolution, neighborhood watch groups that were created with the original intention of thwarting a u.s. invasion.\\', \\'\\', \"u.s. visitors coming via people-to-people trips shouldn\\'t plan on too much beach time.\", \\'\\', \\'under the treasury guidelines, tour operators have to plan nearly every moment of the trip, and \"people-to-people\" travel, at least in theory, excludes relaxing by the pool with umbrella-topped beverages.\\', \\'\\', \\'most americans heading to cuba go there with the desire to make a connection with a people they have been prevented from having any contact with  for generations, according to tom popper, president of tour operator insight cuba.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"the fact that we are bringing americans and cubans together is an incredible thing,\" popper said.  \"it\\\\\\'s a travel experience for the americans, it\\\\\\'s an incredible thing for cubans. some people in parts of cuba that we go to, they have never met an american before.\"\\', \\'\\', \"people-to-people travel isn\\'t cheap or easy, though.\", \\'\\', \\'a four-night \"weekend in havana\" trip from insight cuba, without airfare, sells for about $2,000 per person.\\', \\'\\', \\'popper said the high cost of the trips is due to the fact that operators need to send guides with their groups to make sure they comply with the travel regulations, and that renewing the yearly u.s. licenses can take months of navigating a complicated bureaucracy.\\', \\'\\', \\'this summer, many tour operators wondered if people-to-people travel was ending altogether, after the treasury department started denying licenses to operators or simply not responding to renewal requests.\\', \\'\\', \\'several tour operators contacted by cnn said that the process may have gotten bogged down by the fact that the renewal application is now close to 200 pages and requires that the operators explain how each stop on the itinerary fosters greater friendship between americans and cubans.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"you are doing what you are supposed to be doing and they are changing the rules as we go. the guidelines are so vague,\" said michael sykes, who ran the now-defunct cuba cultural tours.\\', \\'\\', \\'sykes laid off four employees after his license expired in july and he was denied a renewal.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"the language is so cryptic and so bureaucratic,\" he said. \"your average joe isn\\\\\\'t able to do this -- you have to understand the secret language.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'sykes has now hired what he calls a \"bloody expensive\" lawyer to guide him through the process, and he is hopeful that he will be back to planning trips to cuba by the end of the year.\\', \\'\\', \\'some of the tour operators said they thought the logjam of licenses was caused by political pressure, particularly from sen. marco rubio, r-florida, who is cuban-american and a fierce critic of the trips\\', \\'\\', \\'\"what these trips are all about is tourism -- it\\\\\\'s tourism,\" rubio said on the senate floor last year. \"the reason why this is problematic is it gives money to the castro government.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'jeff braunger, a treasury department official in charge of the cuba licensing program, said in an e-mail that the department has approved licenses for 180 tour operators while making sure they are complying with the law.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"we revised the license application criteria to stress to applicants the seriousness of the requirements of the people-to-people licensing program, in part because of reports we received concerning travel under the licenses,\" braunger wrote.\\', \\'\\', \\'but some tour operators said travel to cuba has become more cumbersome and expensive but is not policed any better. one tour organizer mentioned a recent licensed trip offered by a competitor that included a day of scuba diving.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"it\\\\\\'s supposed to be people-to-people, not people-to-fish,\" the operator said.\\', \\'\\', \\'and there are also complications on the cuban side, tour operators said. last month, the cuban government abruptly canceled the landing rights for two of the u.s. charter companies operating flights to the island, reportedly over a payment dispute.\\', \\'\\', \\'but most of the tour operators said the headaches are worth the opportunity to get in early on american tourism to cuba, which is sure to explode when the embargo is eventually lifted.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"we are back in operations and hope to stay that way,\" insight cuba president tom popper said. popper had to lay off 22 people as he waited several months for the company\\\\\\'s license renewal, but he has since added 17 back to his staff.\\', \\'\\', \\'on a trip organized by insight cuba last month, 12 americans spent their morning speaking with cubans at a neighborhood art project.\\', \\'\\', \"michael pettit, a lawyer from charleston, south carolina, said he was struck by cuba\\'s many contrasts during his first people-to-people trip in may.\", \\'\\', \\'\"i love cuba,\" he said. \"the history, music, people, photography -- it\\\\\\'s all beautiful.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'the politics

       " '[\\'\\', \\'that is how president obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at morehouse college this sunday. addressing the historically black all male institution gives obama an opportunity to rectify his strategic neglect of african-americans. in this high-profile talk to his own demographic, the president has some explaining to do.\\', \\'\\', \\'obama\\\\\\'s identity as a black man is usually communicated subliminally, with the swag in his walk, the basketball court on the east lawn, the sexy glances at the first lady, his overall cool. now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern. that\\\\\\'s the good work that calling us \"brothers\" would do.\\', \\'\\', \\'in appearances before african-american audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he\\\\\\'s saying the wrong thing. he told the congressional black caucus to \"stop grumbling, stop complaining, stop crying.\" in a father\\\\\\'s day talk at a black church in chicago, he criticized \"too many fathers\" for \"acting like boys not men.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'african-american men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful african-american man in history. they are on the bottom of many indicators of achievement. they suffer the highest level of incarceration, and the largest homicide rates, of any americans. in urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school. their unemployment is among the highest in the country.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"i\\\\\\'m sorry i haven\\\\\\'t done more.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'the president has not spoken out forcefully against racial profiling and mass incarceration. he has not memorialized the mainly african-american victims of gun violence in chicago the way he has memorialized the mainly white victims of gun violence in newtown and columbine. asked why he hadn\\\\\\'t done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of african-american unemployment, obama said, \"i can\\\\\\'t pass laws that say i\\\\\\'m just helping black folks. i\\\\\\'m president of the entire united states.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'\"thank you for your support.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful african-american man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.\\', \\'\\', \\'but in some ways the african-american community has been too understanding. emanuel cleaver, while chairman of the congressional black caucus, said \"the president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn\\\\\\'t to someone white.\" politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the lgbt community didn\\\\\\'t turn obama into the most gay friendly president in u.s. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment. that\\\\\\'s why the african-american turnout for the president\\\\\\'s re-election was higher than the white turnout.\\', \\'\\', \\'now blacks who supported the president are doing exactly what other groups responsible for his victory are doing: waiting for him to return the favor.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"we\\\\\\'ve all got to do better.\"\\', \\'\\', \"the president isn\\'t the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers. my friend runs a mentoring organization for black boys in prince george\\'s county, maryland, the nation\\'s most affluent black community. there is a long waiting list of boys, mostly without dads in the home, and only about 10 active african-american male mentors.\", \\'\\', \"president obama provides, for morehouse men and everyone else, a 21st century model of african-american masculinity. his oft stated support for women\\'s rights is a crucial component. the casual misogyny of some black popular culture, especially hip-hop music and videos, is a disgrace. it\\'s ok for the president to note that not every aspect of black male culture is praiseworthy.\", \\'\\', \\'\"that includes me.\"\\', \\'\\', \"the government\\'s primary intervention for black men is to lock them up. president obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison. one example would be to speak in favor of decriminalizing marijuana, as have other politicians like new york gov. andrew cuomo.\", \\'\\', \"black men are selectively arrested for marijuana crimes, and these arrests have a stigmatizing effect on future employment and earnings that redounds to the detriment of african-american families. barack obama was once a young black man who smoked pot, and it would be surprising if he actually believes that it\\'s fair for other young black men to be selectively prosecuted for that.\", \\'\\', \\'\"i am the most powerful man in the world, and i\\\\\\'ve got your back.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'those are words profound enough to make a black man cry. i believe them to be true, but hearing them proclaimed out loud would be incredibly meaningful. african-american men feel a special kinship with this president. how inspiring it would be for the president to acknowledge this connection, in his words and in his actions. what a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from morehouse college or becoming president of the united states.\\', \\'\\', \\'the opinions expressed in this

       " '[\\'\\', \"but how do we spend less on technology itself -- that digital drug we can\\'t seem to get enough of? how can we save money on electronic gadgets and services ... so that we can buy more gadgets?\", \\'\\', \\'here are 10 ways to stretch your tech budget this year:\\', \\'\\', \"1. employ smart strips. surge protectors have saved countless gadgets from being electrocuted over the years. but new ones like take charge\\'s power saver smart strip are even better because they save money on your monthly power bill by killing standby power (aka vampire or phantom power) that most electronics consume even when turned off. in my case, after installing two smart strips (one in my office, the other on the entertainment center), i\\'ve saved at least $10 per month on my power bill since august -- more than enough to justify the $30 cost of each.\", \\'\\', \"2. buy less computer (or data). processing power, bandwidth and chipsets used to mean a lot when deciding on a computer or internet provider. but most computers and data plans today are really fast. even when they\\'re not, software developers have made perceptible gains in making gadgets and data feel faster than they really are. so instead of paying for a top-of-the-line machine, blazingly fast speeds or unlimited data, consider a lower-powered but still functional alternative. you\\'d be surprised how many people are buying too much computer or data for their needs.\", \\'\\', \\'3. see gadgets as assets. this is what i call my perpetual technology fund. it works like this: two or three times a year, i identify gadgets, handhelds, old phones, laptops and gaming devices i no longer use (follow the dust) and/or have no intention of using over the next 12 months. the ones with value that i choose not to give away, i\\\\\\'ll resell on craigslist, ebay, or similar classifieds like gazelle.com. in some cases, you can expect several hundred dollars in \"returns,\" which, of course, can then be used to subsidize your next tech purchase.\\', \\'\\', \"4. cut cable tv (and buy your own cable modem). like many tips on my list, this one, too, requires additional effort, but the savings can be immeasurable. first, stop renting a cable or internet modem if you haven\\'t already. they cost less than $50 on average and quickly recoup the $5/month leasing fee. next, see if you can find your favorite shows and programs on streaming websites such as netflix, amazon and hulu. you may have to make a few sacrifices, but $100 a month in savings ain\\'t a bad consolation prize.\", \\'\\', \"5. use freeware as often as you can. after paying hundreds of dollars for accounting software over the years, i recently switched to a free online service. it does everything my old software did at no additional cost. and there are a lot of other freemium software products to help you do what you need for less (or nothing). so get clicky with google and see what\\'s out there.\", \\'\\', \"6. avoid extended warranties. i know a lot of people get peace of mind when buying extended warranties on pricey tvs, smartphones and other gadgets. but the fact remains, according to numerous consumer reports, that extended warranties cost more money on average than what they might eventually save in the unlikely event your gadget breaks beyond its default warranty. this has certainly been the case with me. i\\'ve had stuff covered under warranty. most of my tech survives without problem. and i\\'ve had a few devices out of warranty that i paid for. but overall, i\\'ve saved a lot more than i would have paying for extended warranties. my free accounting software says so!\", \\'\\', \"7. consider refurbished gadgets. contrary to popular myth, refurbished electronics are often as good as new. for example, my friend just bought a beautiful macbook for hundreds less than it would have cost new. it came in a new box. smelled new. featured those protective stickers that are always fun to pull off. and was really shiny. even better, it\\'s still under warranty.\", \\'\\', \"8. buy cheap digital cables. most digital cables are created equal. i say most because i\\'ve had a cheapo digital cable go out on me. but i was only out a few dollars. and most of the knockoff digital cables i\\'ve bought -- including hdmi, iphone cables, audio cables, etc. -- are still going strong after several years. together, they\\'ve helped me pocket hundreds of dollars in savings (which i use to buy more tech).\", \\'\\', \\'9. buy online. before you roll your eyes and let out a big old \"duh,\" remember that shopping online often requires additional patience before seeing significant savings. for example, if you need an item right away and opt for expedited (and costly) shipping, you might be better off to buy at retail. free shipping can take more than a week in some cases. but there are good deals out there. and even if you don\\\\\\'t end up buying online, you should research prices there first before stepping into a brick-and-mortar store.\\', \\'\\', \"10. buy smart rechargeables. rechargeable batteries have come a long way over the last decade. in fact, batteries such as sanyo\\'s eneloops now pack more than enough juice to power all your electronics. these ain\\'t your father\\'s rechargeable batteries, so start buying and start saving.\", \\'\\', \\'@highlight\\',

positively, the favorability percentage for the republican party is even lower -- just 7%, according to one survey. not exactly time to spike the football.\\', \\'\\', \\'of course, no party should govern based solely on popular referendum. that would be stupid. but governing without any concern for what the people want is insane.\\', \\'\\', \\'seven in 10 americans oppose limiting access to abortion, according to a recent poll. so why is it that in the past three years, state legislatures have passed more anti-abortion measures than in the entire previous decade?\\', \\'\\', \\'the new republican leadership in congress should focus on issues such as rebuilding our crumbling bridges and other public infrastructure, or passing bipartisan immigration reform to help level wages and

\\'\\', \"either way, the gop should stop shutting down the government and blocking the president\\'s appointments.\", \\'\\', \\'sure, the american people blame both parties for gridlock. but when

if not, who should be?\\', \\'\\', \\'only about 5% of breast cancers and 10% to 15% of ovarian cancers are caused by mutations in brca1 and brca2. therefore, not everyone needs to undergo genetic testing.\\', \\'\\', \"genetic counselors and other health care providers can help determine whether genetic testing is appropriate by exploring one\\'s personal and family history of cancer and other factors such as ethnicity, as brca1 and brca2 mutations are more common in certain populations.\", \\'\\', \\'how much is brca testing, and does insurance cover it?\\', \\'\\', \\'brca testing is usually covered by insurance if certain criteria are met. there are different types of brca testing, ranging in cost from $475 to about $4,000. genetic counselors are helpful in determining what type of testing is indicated. testing is less expensive once a mutation has been identified within a family.\\', \\'\\', \\'who should get genetic counseling?\\', \\'\\', \\'individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of ashkenazi jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested.\\', \\'\\', \\'when should i be tested?\\', \\'\\', \\'in addition to determining if brca testing is appropriate for you or your family, your health care providers can help you consider when to undergo genetic testing.\\', \\'\\', \\'why more women are choosing double mastectomies\\', \\'\\', \\'it is important to consider when medical management might be changed for individuals with brca1 or brca2 mutations, as this can guide the decision of when to test. for example, breast cancer screening typically starts at age 25 for women with mutations. since brca mutations are not associated with pediatric cancer risks, testing for children is not recommended.\\', \\'\\', \\'what factors should i weigh in deciding whether to have a preventive mastectomy or oophorectomy (ovary removal)?\\', \\'\\', \\'detailed discussions with genetics experts, surgical oncologists, plastic surgeons and genetic counselors are important steps in considering whether and when a prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy is right for you.\\', \\'\\', \\'while the lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancers in brca carriers are high, the risks increase with age. considering the risk of breast or ovarian cancer based on age can be helpful in timing these interventions.\\', \\'\\', \\'since breast cancer screening is good at picking up breast cancers early, when they are most treatable, screening is a reasonable option for carriers. since ovarian cancer screening has not been proven reliably to catch ovarian cancers early, risk-reducing oophorectomy is recommended for brca1 and brca2 carriers, ideally between the ages of 35 and 40.\\', \\'\\', \\'should i test my breasts?\\', \\'\\', \\'@highlight\\', \\'\\', \\'everyone has brca1 and brca2 genes; a mutation can show increased cancer risk\\', \\'\\', \\'@highlight\\', \\'\\', \\'not everyone needs to be tested for the gene mutation\\', \\'\\', \\'@highlight\\', \\'\\', \\'genetic counselors and other providers can help determine whether to test and when\\']',\n",

in the neck. kristen, 2, was stabbed 48 times; a finger was nearly severed as she tried to fend off the blows.\", \\'\\', \\'\"it was overkill,\" said mcginniss, who wrote that macdonald killed his

think of what morris thinks,\" he said. \"macdonald was convicted by a jury in a court of law. he\\\\\\'s not in prison because of me and he\\\\\\'s not going to get out of prison because of errol morris.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'mcginniss also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in macdonald when he embarked on \"fatal vision.\" he says he was embedded with the defense team because he was looking for a different angle.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"i thought it would be fascinating to write about the trial from the point of view of how the defense and defendant were experiencing it. i learned everything from the first time in court. i didn\\\\\\'t have my mind made up.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'mcginniss said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"there

myself, \\\\\\'i think this guy did it,\\\\\\' but he was so charismatic and likable and had such a strong personality. this was before i learned about the psychopathic personality.\"\\', \\'\\', \"mcginniss also disputed the notion raised by the defense and morris that the prosecutor at the criminal trial threatened witness helena stoeckley to alter her testimony. stoeckley, who died in 1983,

22, she went to a dinner party where she met jordan\\'s prince abdullah -- considered one of the world\\'s most eligible bachelors. he didn\\'t remain one for long after that night. six months later, rania and abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. and, though they planned for a life as royals, abdullah assumed he\\'d remain a military officer for life.\", \\'\\', \"in 1999, while on his deathbed, king hussein of jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king. that made 29-year-old rania the world\\'s youngest living queen.\", \\'\\', \\'rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by. \"i am not at all conscious of it,\" she says. \"i make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it. because i\\\\\\'m rania, you know? people call me \\\\\\'queen,\\\\\\' but, you know, that\\\\\\'s not me ... i\\\\\\'m rania.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'there are many perks to being queen, of course, but rania stresses that there are also responsibilities.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"one of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that i might be far removed, that i might not be in touch with reality,\" she says. \"the honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces. that\\\\\\'s something i do on a daily basis.\"  watch how queen rania uses technology to reach young people Â»\\', \\'\\', \\'when most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales. \"for me, it\\\\\\'s just real life,\" rania says. \"i am a mother. i care about my children. i worry about what they eat. i worry about the influences from their friends.\"\\', \\'\\', \"rania is not only sitting royalty in jordan, she\\'s raising the next generation of royals too. she is the mother of four children -- 14-year-old hussein, 12-year-old iman, 8-year-old salma and 3-year-old hashem.\", \\'\\', \\'rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth. the family has relaxed much of the ceremonial pomp and circumstance of their position. rania prefers that people not refer to her as \"your majesty\" ... and king abdullah loves to barbecue!\\', \\'\\', \\'the family never discusses the possibility that hussein, their oldest child, could be the future king of jordan, rania says. instead, she says the family strives to remain like any other family. for instance, to get the things they want, the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"the most important thing is to instill them with the right values,\" rania says. \"i just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life. it protects you from whatever life throws at you.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'rania has become famous around the world for her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls and the rights of women. \"in my mind, poverty is a \\\\\\'she,\\\\\\'\" rania says.\\', \\'\\', \\'helping others is something rania says she feels compelled to do. \"once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself,\" she says. \"and that way you start helping others.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty. \"you can change the course of a nation through education,\" she says. \"one of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education. once she has the education, she can then have control over her income, she can change her life, she can have choices.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'to understand what life is like for the women in rania\\\\\\'s kingdom, \"the oprah show\" spent a day with a few women in amman, the capital city of jordan.\\', \\'\\', \\'one woman named muna worries about striking a balance between work and motherhood. part of that means preparing lunch -- the most important meal in jordanian culture -- for her family. unlike in america, most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch. just like in america, muna cooks a variety of meals, everything from traditional arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti.\\', \\'\\', \\'in this largely muslim country, one religious tradition is increasingly a matter of choice. approximately 60 percent of jordanian women wear a veil. though queen rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"we think it\\\\\\'s a personal choice,\" she says. \"unfortunately, in the west, people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness. this is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief. i always say we should judge a woman according to what\\\\\\'s going on in their heads rather than what\\\\\\'s going on top of their heads.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are. \"once you go beyond the mannerisms, the language, the cultural idiosyncrasies, you realize that you\\\\\\'re basically the same, you know?\" she says.\\', \\'\\', \\'rania also wants to break down the stereotypes the west holds about her culture. \"i would like to dispel the misconception that arabs are all extremists, that arab people are violent and that women in the arab world are oppressed and suppressed,\" she says.\\', \\'\\', \\'the struggle we feel today is not really middle east against the west, rania says, but rather it is between extremists and moderates of all religions. \"we need to speak up,\" she says. \"the biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along, and that\\\\\\'s why we have to get along. we have to communicate more.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'in the future, rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world. \"we look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think, \\\\\\'well, that\\\\\\'s their problem.\\\\\\' but it\\\\\\'s not,\" she says. \"when you solve somebody else\\\\\\'s problem, you\\\\\\'re solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities. \"we have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life,\" she says. \"whenever you\\\\\\'re frustrated and you feel like you don\\\\\\'t have a future or you can\\\\\\'t get a job, then you\\\\\\'re more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology.\" oprah.com: africa\\\\\\'s first-ever elected female president\\', \\'\\', \\'from

subsided within an hour.\", \\'\\', \\'\"for the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" donald mccracken says. \"she had no symptoms. she went to school both days and got an a on her spelling test as usual. there were no issues whatsoever.\"\\', \\'\\', \"but after hearing about richardson\\'s death, the mccrackens wondered if morgan was really as ok as she seemed. after all, richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.\", \\'\\', \\'when they went upstairs to kiss morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"because of natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. and by the time i got off the phone with him, morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" mccracken says.\\', \\'\\', \"the mccrackens took morgan to the emergency room at lakewest hospital in neighboring willoughby, where doctors ordered a ct scan and immediately put morgan on a helicopter to rainbow babies and children\\'s hospital in cleveland, with her father by her side.\", \\'\\', \\'\"i knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to cleveland in an ambulance,\" mccracken said.\\', \\'\\', \"when the helicopter arrived at rainbow, the mccrackens were greeted by dr. alan cohen, the hospital\\'s chief of pediatric neurosurgery. he whisked morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell mccracken that his daughter had the same injury as richardson: an epidural hematoma.\", \\'\\', \\'mccracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had

mccrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get morgan to a doctor. after hearing about richardson\\'s death, many people are asking themselves the same question: do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?\", \\'\\', \\'\"sometimes there\\\\\\'s a gray zone, and there\\\\\\'s no right answer,\" cohen says.  watch for tips on when to go to the er Â»\\', \\'\\', \\'in most cases, it\\\\\\'s pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says greg ayotte, a spokesperson for the brain injury association of america and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"they\\\\\\'re confused, they\\\\\\'re agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.\\', \\'\\', \\'but then there\\\\\\'s what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. in the case of epidural hematomas, the injury richardson and morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. something\\\\\\'s got to give, and that something is the brain,\" ayotte says. if you don\\\\\\'t get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'here, from ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.\\', \\'\\', \\'1. be vigilant\\', \\'\\', \\'keep an eye on someone who has hit his head, even if the person never lost consciousness. \"a lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you\\\\\\'re not knocked out, you\\\\\\'re ok, and that\\\\\\'s not true,\" ayotte says.\\', \\'\\', \\'2. look for dizziness, vomiting, headache and confusion\\', \\'\\', \\'if the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says dr. jam ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at weill cornell medical college in new york, and president of the brain trauma foundation.\\', \\'\\', \\'3. look for changes in symptoms and behavior\\', \\'\\', \"any sudden change, such as morgan\\'s headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention. for example, ghajar says, if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit, it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed.\", \\'\\', \\'4. be especially wary if someone a) has been drinking alcohol, b) is on blood thinners, c) is elderly or d) is a young athlete\\', \\'\\', \"it\\'s tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior, so when in doubt, take the person to the hospital, ghajar says. also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin.\", \\'\\', \\'he also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head. the centers for disease control and prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens. the cdc also has information on concussions in young athletes.\\', \\'\\', \\'5. go to a certified trauma center if you can\\', \\'\\', \"the american college of surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that\\'s not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call. you can also look on this map from the american trauma society. find your state, select trauma centers, update the map, and you can find information about trauma centers in your area.\", \\'\\', \\'the mccrackens say they look back and still can\\\\\\'t believe morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn\\\\\\'t show any signs for 48 hours. \"she didn\\\\\\'t black out, her speech wasn\\\\\\'t slurred, she wasn\\\\\\'t dizzy, she wasn\\\\\\'t any of the things you\\\\\\'d expect,\" mccracken says. \"and you don\\\\\\'t want to be one of those panicky parents who takes their child to the emergency room all the time.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'cohen\\\\\\'s advice after a head

(rodriguez is expected to be back in the lineup for the yankees\\' monday night game in tampa, florida.)\", \\'\\', \\'\\', \"rodriguez was lucky his injury wasn\\'t more serious. he did not get hit

baseball for a pitcher hitting a batter with the ball. yet what the helmet-to-helmet hit is to football, the bean ball and its cousin, the brushback pitch, are to baseball -- a tactic that is potentially life-threatening.\\', \\'\\', \\'the national football league, stung by lawsuits and a series of cases in which autopsies done on players in their 40s and 50s have revealed brain damage, has stiffened penalties for hits to the head and shortened the distance on kickoffs to reduce the violent collisions they produce.\\', \\'\\', \\'by contrast, major league baseball appears to have learned nothing from\\\\xa0history when it comes to rules for protecting batters.\\\\xa0little has changed from 1920, when ray chapman, a shortstop for the cleveland indians, was killed by a high fastball thrown by carl mays of the new york yankees.\\', \\'\\', \\'yet over the years there have been numerous, highly publicized cases of beanings that could easily have been fatal. in 1967 boston red sox outfielder tony conigliaro, the youngest home run champion in american league history, sustained permanent eye damage and missed the rest of the season when he was hit by a pitch from jack hamilton of the california angels.\\', \\'\\', \\'in 2000, new york mets catcher mike piazza was forced to miss the all-star game as a result of the concussion and headaches that followed a beaning by the new york yankees roger clemens, a notorious brushback pitcher, whom piazza had tagged for a grand-slam home run a month earlier.\\', \\'\\', \"how many serious injuries have resulted over the years from batters being hit by pitches is impossible to say. major league baseball has never kept systematic records on this issue and the dark side of the game that it reflects. pitchers who like to intimidate batters and pitchers who don\\'t have good command of their pitches have been free to go about their business without fear of penalty.\", \\'\\', \"major league baseball\\'s substitute for rules that penalize a pitcher for hitting batters has been equipment, namely the plastic helmet.\\\\xa0the helmet became mandatory in 1971 and with the addition of earflaps, helmets have improved over the years.\\\\xa0but mandatory helmets should be a last, not a first, resort when it comes to player safety.\\\\xa0helmets minimize the damage that occurs after a beaning. they fail to give pitchers incentive to avoid throwing brushback pitches in the first place.\", \\'\\', \\'what is needed to make pitchers avoid brushback pitches along with the beanings that come with them are a series of rules with penalties that send a clear message: major league baseball is serious about protecting its players.\\', \\'\\', \\'rule 1: distinguish between a pitch that is dangerous and a pitch that is life-threatening.\\\\xa0the head and face are the most vulnerable areas for a player, and a pitch that hits a player anywhere above his chest should be treated with special harshness.\\\\xa0instead, of being awarded first base, a batter struck above the chest should be given second base and thus put in a position to score on a single.\\', \\'\\', \\'rule 2: treat a pitcher who hits more than one batter differently from a pitcher who hits a single batter. a pitcher who hits a second batter in a game should face automatic ejection and a fine of $10,000, no matter where his pitch lands. the severity of this penalty would mean any pitcher who thrives on intimidation would be put on a short leash, but it would also recognize that a pitcher who has poor control is a menace.\\', \\'\\', \\'rule 3: make a team, not just an individual pitcher, accountable for hit batters. under this rule a team would be able to get away with hitting only one batter per game. any time a second batter was hit, the pitcher who threw the ball would be treated as if he had already struck a batter. a team could not, as a result, game the penalty system for hitting batters.\\', \\'\\', \"rule 4: increase pitcher liability for a hit batsman. rodriguez has been lost to the yankees for a good part of the season, while hernandez, who now has a 13-6 record, has enjoyed a stellar year. the result is unfair to rodriguez and the yankees. the only way to equalize the situation partially is make any pitcher who forces an opponent out of the lineup remain out of his own team\\'s lineup for the same number of games as the injured opponent.\", \\'\\', \\'traditionalists will complain about such reforms, but throughout its history major league baseball has done much to alter its original product. it has made the ball livelier, allowed individual teams to alter their outfields to give themselves an advantage and even banned the spitball.\\', \\'\\', \\'what is different about these hit-batter rule changes is that their aim is safety rather than entertainment. a few batters might take advantage of them and try to get hit, but given the dangers that come from a pitch traveling upward of 90 mph, most batters are not likely to risk their careers just to get on base.\\', \\'\\', \"these reforms don\\'t turn baseball into a game for softies or cheats. instead, they preserve the national

moderate democrats fear a full embrace of warren- and de blasio-style liberalism will herald a return to the party\\'s mcgovern-mondale-dukakis era political wilderness.\", \\'\\', \\'whichever side wins this fight, one thing is already clear: six years after flocking to the banner of obama\\\\\\'s \"hope and change\" candidacy, a lot of progressives are disappointed in the current democratic administration.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"it\\\\\\'s a mixed legacy,\" said adam green, head of the progressive change campaign committee, a washington-based liberal group. \"in some areas, like ending two wars, (obama\\\\\\'s) presidency has represented a return to some sanity. but on the core issue of corporate power and a government that fights for the little guy, this administration so far has had a lot of missed opportunities.\"\\', \\'\\', \"hillary clinton\\'s iowa problem\", \\'\\', \\'among other things, green criticized obama for going along with \"watered down wall street reform\" and \"a republican version of health care reform.\"\\', \\'\\', \"susan schorin, a 68-year-old political activist from virginia, told cnn she is particularly disappointed with obama\\'s willingness to consider changes to social security that could lead to a reduction in future benefits.\", \\'\\', \\'\"i feel betrayed,\" said schorin, a member of green\\\\\\'s organization and a volunteer for the obama campaign group organizing for america. obama \"was so enthusiastic and identified with saving these programs for people who really need them. he was extremely verbal about it.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'obama\\\\\\'s a \"great man,\" schorin insisted. but he \"turned his back on me and on all of the people that voted for him on that promise.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'on the other side, the president and vice president of the centrist think tank third way published an op-ed in the wall street journal in december warning that de blasio- and warren-style liberalism would be \"disastrous for democrats.\"\\', \\'\\', \"5 things about new york\\'s new mayor\", \\'\\', \\'\"while new yorkers think of their city as the center of the universe, the last time its mayor won a race for governor or

1960.\"\\', \\'\\', \"warren: end \\'too big to fail\\'\", \\'\\', \\'in another dig at warren, they argued that plans to boost social security benefits are \"exhibit a of this populist political and economic fantasy.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'one week later, warren fired off a letter to the heads of six major banks, pushing them to disclose any contributions the banks may have made to think tanks.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"shareholders have a right to know how corporate resources are spent, and, even more importantly, policymakers and the public should be aware of your contributions and evaluate the work of the think tanks accordingly,\" she wrote.\\', \\'\\', \"meanwhile, with obama\\'s last campaign now well behind him, several left-leaning groups that had previously kept quiet for the sake of the president\\'s re-election are now echoing green\\'s criticism and bucking the administration on a number of issues.\", \\'\\', \\'earlier this month, a coalition of 18 environmental organizations sent the white house a letter warning that obama\\\\\\'s \"all of the above\" energy strategy -- one that embraces so-called \"green energy\" and more domestic extraction of traditional fossil fuels -- is unacceptable for those sounding the alarm about climate change.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"an \\\\\\'all of the above\\\\\\' strategy is a compromise that future generations can\\\\\\'t afford,\" the letter declared. \"it increases environmental injustice while it locks in the extraction of fossil fuels that will inevitably lead to a catastrophic climate future.\"\\', \\'\\', \"liberal groups made their displeasure clear last year when obama considered larry summers -- a key member of bill clinton\\'s economic team -- to head the federal reserve. obama ultimately went with janet yellen.\", \\'\\', \"a number of progressive leaders also pushed back against obama\\'s proposed airstrikes in syria, and made clear their unhappiness with the recent budget deal that froze spending on key liberal domestic priorities.\", \\'\\', \"obama, who originally emerged from the more liberal wing of the democratic party, appears sympathetic at least to the economic populism arguments. in a speech in december to the left-leaning center for american progress, the president made clear that america\\'s growing wealth disparity would be a focus of his remaining time in office.\", \\'\\', \\'\"increasing inequality is most pronounced in our country and it challenges the very essence of who we are as a people,\" he declared.\\', \\'\\', \\'obama says income gap eroding american dream\\', \\'\\', \\'while divided democrats will soon begin their search for a new standard-bearer, political observers warn not to make too much of the differences now bubbling to the surface.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"both parties have a far greater degree of programmatic consensus than they did 40 or 50 years ago. this is one reason why the parties have polarized and why it is often difficult to achieve bipartisan compromises,\" noted george washington university political scientist john sides.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"the differences between obama, hillary clinton, warren (and others) are mostly at the margins,\" he argued. \"there is far more agreement than disagreement on the fundamental issues.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'de blasio and the clintons: the ties that bind?\\', \\'\\', \\'\"by their nature, political parties are coalitions of mostly like-minded voters and groups,\" johns hopkins university political scientist adam sheingate added.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"it\\\\\\'s not uncommon for there to be differences on policy issues within the coalition, or a range of opinions on issues that span part of the political spectrum.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'regardless, schiller argued that the financial demands of modern presidential campaigns may ultimately spell defeat for de blasio- and warren-style economic populism.\\', \\'\\', \\'the political war over poverty\\', \\'\\', \\'\"there is a strong voice within the democratic party that believes barack obama has not done enough to protect the average working voter,\" she said.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"for now elizabeth warren personifies that voice, but when

september 10th, they\\\\\\'d be able to do something about it, thanks to a new element called \"the steal,\" which allows judges to pick up a contestant who\\\\\\'s been ousted by another coach. journalists got a sneak peak at a recently taped battle round between two of green\\\\\\'s competitors, who each delivered a smoking rendition of mariah carey\\\\\\'s \"vision of love.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'as soon as green carried out the unenviable task of choosing just one, the other coaches hammered on their buttons and made their pitches to bring the loser onto one of their teams, just like they do in the battle rounds. judges can only pick two additional team members, which will lead to a new cycle of the show called \"knockout rounds,\" where the teams will pare down before beginning the live episodes.\\', \\'\\', \\'the new opportunity for poaching has added a lot to the show, the coaches told rolling stone. \"it\\\\\\'s nice to throw those elements in to kind of spice things up,\" levine said. \"those things definitely help keep it fresh for us.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'it also adds more pressure, shelton said. \"there\\\\\\'s nothing that\\\\\\'s more nervewracking than knowing, \\\\\\'okay, both these singers did really good and i gotta pick one and i know damn good and well one of these other three are gonna steal the person i don\\\\\\'t pick,\\\\\\'\" he said. \"there\\\\\\'s a chance that person may go on and win this and that\\\\\\'s gonna make me look really stupid. that definitely goes on in your mind. as an artist and somebody on television i have enough of an ego that i don\\\\\\'t want to look that stupid. i want to look brilliant.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'ultimately, though, he recognizes it\\\\\\'s great for the show and viewers. \"it\\\\\\'s going to be so exciting for people watching at home,\" shelton said. \"here\\\\\\'s the truth, as much as we want to sit up here and talk about how different this show is, and it is, what people love the most is those damn buttons. people love to see us hit those buttons and somebody\\\\\\'s life is changed at that moment. this is another way of changing somebody\\\\\\'s life later on in the show, where they think all hope is lost, they\\\\\\'re going home, the next thing you know the button gets pushed and they\\\\\\'re right back in the game again. that\\\\\\'s pretty exciting.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'the new components add another element to what levine, aguilera and shelton call \"the best season yet.\" only green holds out on that, saying, \"a few memorable things have happened thus far, but season three isn\\\\\\'t completed yet, so i don\\\\\\'t know if this is the favorite season yet.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'for the four coaches, though, the biggest strength of this season is their bond. in the first clip shown at the junket, the four are seen performing the rolling stones\\\\\\' \"start me up,\" and they resembled a band, much more than they did in the combined performances of the first two seasons.\\', \\'\\', \\'what helped meld them into a tight, family-like unit is the way all four work with contestants, aguilera said. \"over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it\\\\\\'s so nice to see,\" she said. \"it\\\\\\'s refreshing because we came into it not wanting to knock anybody down and i think we all respect that. we might take shots at each other, but never the talent. so there\\\\\\'s just a magic, there\\\\\\'s a bond there that\\\\\\'s unbreakable at this point.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'shelton concurred, recognizing the quartet is now joined together by the success of the series. \"we\\\\\\'re always going to be connected to each other through this show,\" he says.\\', \\'\\', \\'he admitted there have been some rough moments, like any family. \"we\\\\\\'ve been through a lot of s**t with each other, no doubt,\" he said. \"we\\\\\\'ve had fights, ups and downs and weird moments and f**k-offs and all that stuff. but all friends go through that i think and you either go through it and you never speak to each other again or you go through it and your relationship is even stronger. we didn\\\\\\'t have to come back together, but we did, and our relationships are stronger.\"\\', \\'\\', \\'levine agreed that the coaches have left the rockiest moments behind them. \"we are getting along better than we ever have and i guess our energies have all congealed and we\\\\\\'re very, very close at this point,\" he said.\\', \\'\\', \\'the show will run this year in both the fall and spring seasons, which could result in one or more of the coaches having to take a sabbatical to go on tour. although burnett said the coaches have their \"chairs for live,\" the assembled journalists were keen to speculate on who the replacement coaches might be. green shut down the speculation while nicely summing up the bond among the current four.\\', \\'\\', \\'\"for me, there\\\\\\'s nobody comes to mind that can replace my blake, my adam and my christina,\" he said.\\', \\'\\', \\'see full story at rollingstone.com.\\', \\'\\', \\'copyright Â© 2011 rolling
